            <p1>Drawing opens the door to creativity, animation brings creativity to life. Animation has always been something that has fascinated me, and something that I have longed to learn. In recent years, I have done a lot of exploration in taking past or active drawings and turning them into animated stories. I have always loved to draw and write, because those are two ways to effectively communicate a story. Animation allows those concepts to connect, creating one fluid method of visually conveying a story.</p1>

            <p1>This method of animation requires an iPad or tablet, and works best when there is an additional pen tool to assist it. It simulates analog drawing, but carries it into a digital age. With this interface, users can step by step create clasic flip-book style, hand-drawn animations. </p1>

        <p1>This software utilizes a process called Keyframe Animation. This is when users choose specific points in time, or ranges in time, where an action is supposed to happen. It is less focused on the feel of drawing, and more focused on moving key elements, the camera angle, or other assets within the animation. This is less commonly used for character animations, but can accomplish many things with creativity.</p1>
