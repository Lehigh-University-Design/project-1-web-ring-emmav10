        <h1>An Introduction To Drawing</h1>
        
        <div id="post">
            <p>Many people start their journey drawing as a child. It may take form as some scribbles on a page, or some beautiful stick figures, but it is a way for children to express themselves. As we grow up, we tend to develop the idea that these drawings are not good enough, and many people are too discouraged to work towards progressing their skills. However, drawing is something incredibly unique to each individual. It is a form of expression that opens your world to any direction that your pen can move. There is no right or wrong way to draw, and the beauty truly is in the eye of the beholder.</p1>

            <p1>When it comes to drawing styles, there are specific practices and techniques that will produce the creator with all different kinds of results. For example, there are ways to measure the world with your pen in order to produce correct proportions. Alternatively, some styles of drawing are made entirely to exaggerate reality and/or turn it into fiction.</p1>
